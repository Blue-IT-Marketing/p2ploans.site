In addition to these Terms of Use, you may enter into other agreements with us or others that will govern your use of the Service or related services offered by us or others. If there is any contradiction between these Terms of Use and another agreement you enter into applicable to specific aspects of the Service, the other agreement shall take precedence in relation to the specific aspects of the Service to which it applies. As used herein, "Users" means anyone who accesses and/or uses the Site. For any terms herein applicable to all Users, all applicants, whether individually or jointly, all investor members, or business and other entity Users specifically, or where the context otherwise requires, "Users" shall be deemed to include any business or other entity on behalf of which the Site or Service is accessed by any other User, and "you" shall be deemed to include any such business or other entity and any person acting on behalf of any such business or other entity in connection with the use of the Site or Service. For purposes of these Terms of Use, a sole proprietor participating in our Small Business lending program is deemed to be acting on behalf of a business.
    Changes to these Terms of Use</p>

        <p>We may make changes to these Terms of Use from time to time. If we do this, we will post the changed Terms of Use on the Site and will indicate at the top of this page the date the Terms of Use were last revised. You understand and agree that your continued use of the Service or the Site after we have made any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Use.</p>

        <h3>ALL USERS: CONSENT TO ELECTRONIC TRANSACTIONS AND DISCLOSURES</h3>

        <p>Because the LendingClub financial platform operates only on the Internet, whether you choose to participate on our platform as a borrower, investor or in any other manner, it is necessary for you to consent to transact business with us online and electronically. As part of doing business with us and WebBank, a Utah industrial bank that is the lender of all loans ("WBK"), therefore, we also need you to consent to our giving you certain disclosures electronically, either via our Site or to the email address you provide to us. By agreeing to the Terms of Use, you agree to receive electronically all documents, communications, notices, contracts, and agreements (including any IRS Form 1099) arising from or relating to your use of the Site and Service, including any loans you may request or receive, your registration as a borrower or investor on our Site, any loans you may fund, notes you have purchased, your use of this Service, and the servicing of your loan, if funded, as either a borrower or investor member of LendingClub (each, a "Disclosure"), from us, whether we are acting in the capacity as trustee or otherwise, or WBK. An IRS Form 1099 refers to any Form 1099 or other Form, Schedule or information statement, including corrections of such documents, required to be provided pursuant to U.S. Internal Revenue Service rules and regulations and that may be provided electronically (each, an "IRS Form 1099"). The decision to do business with us and WBK electronically is yours. This document informs you of your rights concerning Disclosures.</p>

        <h3>CUSTOMER COMMUNICATIONS: By accepting these Terms of Use, you expressly consent to be contacted by us, our agents, representatives, affiliates, or anyone calling on our behalf for any and all purposes, at any telephone number, or physical or electronic address you provide or at which you may be reached. You agree we may contact you in any way, including SMS messages (including text messages), calls using prerecorded messages or artificial voice, and calls and messages delivered using auto telephone dialing system or an automatic texting system. Automated messages may be played when the telephone is answered, whether by you or someone else. In the event that an agent or representative calls, he or she may also leave a message on your answering machine, voice mail, or send one via text.</h3>

        <p>You consent to receive SMS messages (including text messages), calls and messages (including prerecorded and artificial voice and autodialed) from us, our agents, representatives, affiliates or anyone calling on our behalf at the specific number(s) you have provided to us, or numbers we can reasonably associate with your account (through skip trace, caller ID capture or other means), with information or questions about your application, loan and/or account. You certify, warrant and represent that the telephone numbers that you have provided to us are your numbers and not someone else's. You represent that you are permitted to receive calls at each of the telephone numbers you have provided to us. You agree to alert us whenever you stop using a particular telephone number.</p>

        <p>TELEMARKETING CALLS: If you have provided consent for telemarketing calls, you agree that (i) we, our agents, representatives, affiliates, third parties, and anyone calling on our behalf may call, email or SMS messages (including text messages) you at the numbers and addresses you have provided for purposes of describing goods and services that may be of interest to you, offered by us, our affiliates and/or third parties; (ii) agree these calls, text and email messages may be made using an automatic dialing or email system technology and/or involve prerecorded and/or artificial voice messaging. Your consent, if provided, will be effective even if the number you have provided is registered on any state or federal Do-Not-Call (DNC) list. This consent for telemarketing calls shall remain in effect until you revoke it. Your consent to telemarketing calls may be revoked by informing the telemarketing representative, or any other method, which ensures we receive the revocation.</p>

        <p>Your consent to telemarketing calls is not a condition of obtaining your loan.</p>

        <p>You also understand that your cellular or mobile telephone provider will charge you according to the type of plan you carry.</p>

If you require paper copies of such Disclosures, you may sign in to your account on our Site and print the documents desired or you may write to us at the mailing address provided below and a paper copy will be sent to you at a cost of up to $5.00 per document requested. If you do not consent to receive an IRS Form 1099 electronically when you agree to these Terms of Use or subsequently revoke such consent, a paper copy of any IRS Form 1099 required to be delivered to you after the effective time of your failure to consent or revocation of consent will be sent to you at no cost. However, a fee may be charged for any additional or replacement copies of such IRS Form 1099. A request for a paper copy of any Disclosure will not be considered a withdrawal of your consent to receive Disclosures electronically. Any IRS 1099 Forms provided electronically will remain accessible through at least October 15 of the year in which such IRS Form 1099 is made available; after that time the IRS Form 1099 may no longer be accessible electronically. We may discontinue electronic provision of Disclosures at any time in our sole discretion.</p>

        <p>Scope of Consent. Your consent to receive Disclosures and transact business electronically, and our agreement to do so, applies to any transactions to which such Disclosures relate, whether between you and LendingClub or between you and WBK. Your consent will remain in effect for so long as you are a User and, if you are no longer a User, will continue until such a time as all Disclosures relevant to transactions that occurred while you were a User have been made.</p>
