          </div>

          <p>What is Peer to Peer Lending, well let us just take a look at a description of <strong>peer to peer lending from WikiPedia</strong> </p>

          <p><strong>Peer-to-peer lending</strong>, sometimes abbreviated <strong>P2P Lending</strong>, is the practice of lending money to individuals or businesses
            through online services that match lenders directly with borrowers.</p>
           Since the peer-to-peer lending companies offering these services operate entirely online, they can run with lower overhead and provide the service
            more cheaply than traditional financial institutions.</p>

            <p>As a result, lenders often earn higher returns compared to savings and investment products offered by banks,
              while borrowers can borrow money at lower interest rates, even after the <strong>P2P Lending Company</strong> has taken a
              fee for providing the <strong>match-making platform</strong> and <strong>credit checking the borrower</strong>.</p>

          <h4 class="box-title">Also known as <strong>Crowd Lending</strong>, <strong>many peer-to-peer loans are unsecured personal loans</strong>, though some of the largest
              amounts are lent to businesses.</h4>

          <p><p></p><strong>Secured Loans</strong> are sometimes offered by using luxury assets such as jewelry, watches, vintage cars, fine art,
            buildings, aircraft and other business assets as collateral. They are made to an individual, company or charity.</p>

          <p>Other forms of <strong>peer-to-peer lending include student loans</strong>, <strong>commercial and real estate loans</strong>, <strong>payday loans</strong>,
            as well as <strong>secured business loans, leasing, and factoring.</strong></p></blockquote>


            <p>The interest rates can be set by lenders who compete for the lowest rate on the reverse auction model or
              fixed by the intermediary company on the basis of an analysis of the borrower's credit.</p>

          <h4 class="box-title">The lender's investment in the loan is not normally protected by any government guarantee.</h4>
            <blockquote>
            <p>On some services, lenders mitigate the risk of bad debt by choosing which borrowers to lend to,
              and mitigate total risk by diversifying their investments among different borrowers.</p>

            <p>Other models involve the P2P lending company maintaining a separate, ringfenced fund, such as
            RateSetter's Provision Fund, which pays lenders back in the event the borrower defaults, but the value
              of such provision funds for lenders is subject to debate.[3]</p>
             </blockquote>

            <h4 class="box-title">Bankruptcy of the peer-to-peer lending company that facilitated the loan may also put a lender's investment
              at risk, as has happened in 2015 in the case of TrustBuddy.</h4>

            <blockquote>The lending intermediaries are for-profit businesses; they generate revenue by collecting a one-time fee
            on funded loans from borrowers and by assessing a loan servicing fee to investors (tax-disadvantaged in
              the UK vs charging borrowers) or borrowers (either a fixed amount annually or a percentage of the loan amount).</blockquote>

            <p>Compared to stock markets, peer-to-peer lending tends to have both less volatility and less liquidity.[4]</p>
