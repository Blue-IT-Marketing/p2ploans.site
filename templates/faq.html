                            <p><strong>P2P Loans</strong> works by first allowing you an opportunity to <strong>become a loan financier</strong>, you are able to do this on
                              your profile by allocating a portion of your available funds in your <strong>wallet into your loan pocket</strong>.</p>
                            <p>This funds will then be used to fund p2pLoans.com loan clients, after a successfull loan finance round you
                              are then allowed to accept a loan of up to fifteen percent more of the total funds you financed other loans with,
                            you can then choose to either transfer your loan pocket into your wallet or continue financing other clients until
                              you reach an amount you are satisfied with. this allows you to earn a lot of compound interest on your initial investment, into your loan pocket</p>
                            </p>

                          </li>

                            <h3>How Much can i get in Loans</h3>
                            <p><strong>P2P Loans</strong> does not place a restriction as to how much you can realistically earn as interest on your initial financed amount,
                            however you can only earn 15% on any loan pocket amount from which you can perpetually finance others until you are satisfied.</p>
                            <strong>This is how you can do it:</strong>
                            <ol class="list-group">
                              <li class="list-group-item">You place an initial loan pocket of $ 100.00 and its all taken as loans,</li>
                              <li class="list-group-item">Then you can realistically now obtain a loan of 15% more than the hundred dollars
                            you previously financed others with. which will mean that your loan pocket now has $ 115.00 which you can then re-finance and so on and so on</li>
                              <li class="list-group-item">There's also no limit as to how many times you can go through the circle of finance - loan in one day </li>
                              <li class="list-group-item">However lets assume you can go over the circle of loan and finance twice in one day then in one week you can earn :
