          <p>An Online Crowd Funding and Peer to Peer Loan Platform which allows you to make money 24 hours a day. coupled
          with our Affiliate System our platform offers you a higher opportunity to earn an income on a daily basis, and the only
          thing you need to do is create your profile fund it ...and then promote just one project or fund a loan, which in turn
              will allow you to create your own crowd funding project, or loan request.</p>

          <blockquote>Here is a detailed explanation of our several platforms that allows you to earn an income:


           </blockquote>

          <h3>P2P Loans</h3>

          <blockquote>
              P2P Loans is a platform that allows you to either apply for a loan and also able to fund/finance a loan request from your
              peers.

              Users of our Peer to Peer Loan Platform are divided into two groups i.e we have
              <ul class="list-group">
                  <li class="list-group-item">
                      <h3>Loan Financier</h3>
                      <p>Every user is required to at least finance a single loan in order to qualify to receive a loan , this is done by first funding your Wallet
                          and then under the Peer to Peer Loans Tab you need to allocate a certain amount of that wallet into your Loan Pocket.</p>

                      <p>This will allow other loans to be financed from your loan pocket either automatically or by your choosing.</p>

                      <p>The amount in cash of Loans financed from your loan pocket plus fifteen percent becomes your limit when you request for loans
                          in the future.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li class="list-group-item">
                      <h3>Loan Client</h3>
                      <p>Now this is the guy who will receive the loan, or is being financed by his loan financier. every loan financier will then be allowed
                      to become a loan client and a limit as to the money he can receive from other loan financiers will be capped at the amount he financed other loans
                      plus fifteen percent on that amount.</p>
                      <p>Note: Your loan client will not necessarily become your financier on your next financing round.
                      <blockquote>Meaning if you finance your loan to me i do not necessarily have to pay the loan back to you, i just have to pay it back to someone
                            within the platform</blockquote></p>
                  </li>
              </ul>

          </blockquote>

          <h3>Affiliates</h3>
          <blockquote>
              <p>Our Members can also make extra income by becoming affiliates, this opportunity allows one to promote our platform making use of several
                  approved marketing methods, allowing the client or affiliate to build their team from where they can earn income from ten percent on the earnings
                  of each of their Affiliate's.</p>
